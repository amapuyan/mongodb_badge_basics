## Differences & Scenario
One key difference between relational and non-relational databases is how they structure and store data. Relational databases like MySQL use tables with fixed schemas and relationships defined by foreign keys, while non-relational databases like MongoDB store data in flexible, JSON-like documents that can vary in structure. This allows MongoDB to handle unstructured or rapidly changing data more easily. In healthcare, MongoDB would be appropriate for storing patient health records that include variable data such as lab results, wearable device readings, and clinical notes, since these records often differ from one patient to another and evolve over time. Its flexible schema and scalability make it ideal for managing diverse, complex health data efficiently.
